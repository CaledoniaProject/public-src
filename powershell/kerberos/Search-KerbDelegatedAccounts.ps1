.Synopsis
    Search the domain for accounts with Kerberos Delegation.
.DESCRIPTION
    Kerberos Delegation is a security sensitive configuration. Especially
    full (unconstrained) delegation has significant impact: any service
    that is configured with full delegation can take any account that
    authenticates to it, and impersonate that account for any other network 
    service that it likes. So, if a Domain Admin were to use that service,
    the service in turn could read the hash of KRBRTG and immediately 
    effectuate a golden ticket. Etc :)
    
    This scripts searches AD for regular forms of delegation: full, constrained,
    and resource based. It dumps the account names with relevant information (flags)
    and adds a comment field for special cases. The output is a PSObject that
    you can use for further analysis. 
    
    Note regarding resource based delegation: the script dumps the target 
    services, not the actual service doing the delegation. I did not bother 
    to parse that out. 
    
    Main takeaway: chase all services with unconstrained delegation. If 
    these are _not_ DC accounts, reconfigure them with constrained delegation, 
    OR claim them als DCs from a security perspective. Meaning, that the AD 
    team manages the service and the servers it runs on.
